Can A user select a number instead of a range
Is there a way to set preference in the optimizer of weither low weight births goes down or ___ goes up?

Equaation Indicators >= 0 Regression
LWB <= Maximum (boundary intial value)(unless) there is no solution
	
	What is the loss of the leftmost gauge?
		Might be harder for me to debug.
		Telling the direction.
	
	1) Thirten Sliders instead of just one (recode the old part)
	Thirteen test gauges?
	2) Two Tabs of 13 guages (but)
	3) Instead of 13 gauses we have 13 sliders but inside there own 		tab, 
	4) If we combine to two changes we need to then change the title 		of 	the gauge from test to regular
		Have S for Setup or R for Result

	5) Different Themes for intinal and final guages
	6) CWBI in the game tab as the others by remove Left most Guage
		Solid Gauge (semi)
	Walk through we have and discuss options
Map, Ginneh. 
	She' got a CWBI map already. An census track map.
	The resulting color 

What else need to be done
	Fixed Values as a number (allows you to enter values insted of using a slider) (Toyin and Eva)
	Put Zero or leave blank the values you don't want to fix.
	It uses the sliders for the other values.
	Think about how to explain the loss of the left gauge as something we comapre to ginna

	Have a prefered direction for the slider
	LeGEND
	Map Labels and Map highlighting the value you that you hover over
	Use the color Ginna want us to use.
	
	Sally: Correlations to help the user figure out what variables to 	fix or not?
	Make the map fill the screen
	Legend and Range
