# CWBI-S Team Members: Software, Links, and Code Management Stuff
for background and requirements, go to the [Link](README.MD)

##  New Team Members:  Tools, Links, Code Management!
    1. The CWBI Project is using a github repository
    a quick guide:[link](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#what)
    GitHub Desktop is a helper app that runs locally on your machine interacts with Github server
    2. The repository is at: [link](https://github.com/mlane3/unitedway")
    3. Contributors need the RStudio IDE, [link](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/")
    4. If you just need a quick brushup on R, check out [link](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/">cheatsheets)
    5. The Shiny add-in library for CWBI [link](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/)
    and other R libraries as applicable (refer to R code for current list)

##  Workflow to contribute:
1. Joining the project
The first step is to Join the Project!  The process of joining the project you will receive an e-mail from either Mike Lane (Admin and Coding Lead) or GitHub.  Accept the invitation contained in this e-mail to join the project, and you will be granted access to the repository.
2. Working from a branch of the Project Master.
Team members work from a branch (good coding practice, reduce risk of screwing up the master, provide clearer traceability of committed changes) and you will work with our GitHub Admin to have a new branch created or be assigned to an existing branch. Branches are created from the main page of GitHub in the branch selector menu.

3. You may clone, download as .zip, or download into GitHub Desktop all the project (branch) files.  You will see the button on the main page to do this.

4. Pull Requests and Commits.
Working from your assigned Branch, Create a pull request to propose changes. These changes are proposed in a branch, which gives and extra degree of control over the Master.
Pull requests can only be opened if there are differences between your branch and the upstream branch.  Usually you will be working on a fix to an item from our project ISSUES LIST.  By entering a proper commit message in the format of a keyword followed by the issue number, GITHUB will associate your change with that issue and indicate that issue as closed (EX.  "closed #99"). The keywords that can be used in this way are close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed.

Pull requests let you communicate your proposed changes. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review your changes with collaborators and add commit comments (as noted above) before the changes are merged into the repository.

5. Issues List
The issues list is an item on the main tab in the Project on GitHub. Issues may be very specific and contain the section of code that needs work, or may describe a feature that needs to be added.  Many GitHub projects use the issues list as a "project board" for requirements.  As we write requirements, the goal will be to make them atomic, cohesive, and loosely coupled to facilitate pushing them to the issues list so they can easily be picked up and worked.

6. If there is anything that should be added to either this or the readme.md file, to make the project clear to any but particularly new, coding team members, please bring it up at the next project meeting!
